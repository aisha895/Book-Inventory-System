**Book Inventory System **


A simple Java-based inventory management system for books, built with a Swing-based GUI. This application allows users to add, view, filter, update, and delete books in an inventory system. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and uses a DAO (Data Access Object) pattern for database operations.
